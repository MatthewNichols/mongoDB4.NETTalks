#Intro to MongoDB for .NET 

* What is MongoDB?
    * A document database, what's that?
* Benefits and Features:
    * Schemaless 
    * Multi-dimensional
    * Incredably Productive for development 
    * Fully indexable
    * Built to scale horizontally
    * No "Object-relational impedance mismatch"; data feels like objects
    * Data access is stupidly easy. No ORM needed
    * Supports subclassing easily
* Downsides?
    * Learning curve
    * No Joins, No Transactions? What????
        * Both are very expensive operations across machines
        * Doesn't matter as much as you might think 
* Examples/Demo
    * Installing
        * Config file
        * Setting up as a service
    * The obligatory Hello World
        * Connecting to MongoDB
    * Something a little more useful
        * Inserting
        * Reading/Searching
        * Deleting
    * An example of a typical schema
        * Here is why the lack of transactions is rarely that big a deal
        * If you still need transactions take a hybrid approach
    * Indexing
    * Mapping
        * Conventions
    * Quick examples in one or two other frameworks
        * NodeJs
