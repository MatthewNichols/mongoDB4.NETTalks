<h1>Intro to MongoDB for .NET</h1>

<ul>
<li>What is MongoDB?
<ul>
<li>A document database, what's that?...explain basic structures; collections, documents, indexes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Benefits and Features:
<ul>
<li>Highly scalable and available. Built to scale horizontally and to replicate</li>
<li>Schemaless and Multi-dimensional
<ul>
<li>Ok there is almost certainly a schema, but it is managed by a the application, not in fixed structures in the database</li>
<li>Open source and well supported</li>
<li>Everything is JSON(ish, explain BSON a little bit) but fully indexable</li>
<li>which brings us to...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Incredibly Productive for development 
<ul>
<li>Supports subclassing easily</li>
<li>No "Object-relational impedance mismatch"; data feels like objects</li>
<li>Data access is stupidly easy. No ORM needed</li>
<li>Because the schema is managed by the application a bunch of typical DB problems become very easy to handle...DB version control, schema maintenance in local dbs, deploys, maintaining test data</li>
<li>LINQ support...though not in the current version of the driver, probably returning in 2.1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Full text indexes</li>
<li>Easy to set up highly available ReplicaSets</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Downsides?
<ul>
<li>A little (re)learning curve for people who have been doing relational for a long time. Frankly for new developers I would say it is much easier than relational.</li>
<li>Feature vs Scalability chart?</li>
<li>No Joins, No Transactions, No constriants? What????
<ul>
<li>Remember MongoDB assumes multi-instance scaling will be used and these are very expensive operations across instances</li>
<li>Doesn't matter as much as you might think </li>
<li>Joins and constraints can be done, but they are done in the application layer and require a round trip.  Caching can be useful here</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not great tooling out of the box.  But a growing number of third party tools.</li>
<li>Querying outside of application code takes getting used to (just like SQL did, remember?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples/Demo
<ul>
<li>Installing
<ul>
<li>Config file</li>
<li>Setting up as a service</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The obligatory Hello World
<ul>
<li>Connecting to MongoDB</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Something a little more useful
<ul>
<li>Inserting</li>
<li>Reading/Searching</li>
<li>Deleting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An example of a typical schema
<ul>
<li>Here is why the lack of transactions is rarely that big a deal</li>
<li>If you still need transactions take a MongoDB/SQL hybrid approach.  This can also be useful for reporting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Indexing</li>
<li>Mapping
<ul>
<li>Conventions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quick examples in one or two other frameworks
<ul>
<li>NodeJs (MEAN stack maybe?)</li>
<li>??</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
